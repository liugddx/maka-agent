   * value change (`editable.textContent = controlledValue`), which is correct
   * for text and lossy for tokens: the chip spans go, and the draft comes back
   * as the `/skill:<id>` text they serialize to. Upstream declares a
   * `deserialize` hook for exactly this and never calls it (facebook/astryx
   * #4655), so until it does, we re-insert the chips ourselves.
   *
   * Nothing is recovered here that was not already in the string — the draft
   * stays the single source of truth, and this only restores its rendering.
   * That is what keeps it deletable in one piece: when upstream deserializes,
   * this function and its one call site go, and no state goes with them.
   *
   * Three preconditions, all cheap, all necessary:
   *
   * - Only for an external write. `redrawPendingRef` is set by `textPort.setValue`
   *   — the sole funnel for draft swap, history recall and the imperative handle
   *   — and cleared by `applyText`, so a user who has taken the draft back never
   *   watches a half-typed `/skill:` seize into a chip under the caret.
   * - Only on the DOM shape that write produces: exactly one text node equal to
   *   the draft. Anything else means upstream skipped the rewrite (the chips are
   *   still there) or the editor is in a shape whose offsets we cannot trust.
   * - Never mid-composition. The rewrite already broke the IME's composition;
   *   moving the selection on top of that makes it worse.
   *
   * A pending redraw survives a failed attempt, and that is the whole reason it
   * is a flag rather than a call at the write. The two inputs do not arrive
   * together: switching sessions swaps the draft on the spot while the Skill
   * catalog for the newly active session lands a render or two later, still
   * holding the previous session's Skills. Clearing on the first attempt would
   * read that stale catalog as proof the token is unresolvable and give up for
   * good. Retrying costs one regex over a short draft on renders where a write
   * is outstanding, and every other precondition — mid-composition, an
   * unexpected DOM — gets the same second chance for free.
   *
   * Back to front, because `Range.deleteContents` inside a text node leaves the
   * original node holding the text before the range: earlier offsets stay valid,
   * later ones would not. The token's own matched text becomes the chip value,
   * not a value rebuilt from the catalog id, so a differently-cased token comes
   * back spelled the way the draft spells it.
   *
   * `insertToken` anchors each chip with a U+00A0, so we take the following
   * space into the replaced range to keep one separator rather than two. The
   * draft therefore serializes with U+00A0 where it had a space, and with one
   * extra U+00A0 when a token ends the draft. That is the same text a chip
   * picked from the `/` menu produces, `composerWireText` normalizes it on send,
   * and upstream's sync effect is keyed on the controlled value rather than on
   * the serialization, so the difference cannot loop back as a rewrite.
   *
   * A token whose id is not in the live catalog stays text: no chip should claim
   * a Skill that will not resolve.
