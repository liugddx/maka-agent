// This file had four stories and three of them rendered nothing. The strip
// reports by exception — `capabilityAuditIssues` returns [] and the component
// returns null unless a source needs auth or is erroring, or an automation
// failed or was skipped — and `report()` defaults all four of those counts to
// 0. So `SkillsFocusHealthy`, `AutomationsFocusHealthy` and `Empty` were blank
// panels carrying confident "Real path:" sentences that described behavior the
// component lost when it stopped summarizing healthy state. The app state they
// named is "this strip is not on the page", which needs no story.

 * a `maxWidth: 720; padding: 24` box the app never renders, plus
 * `data-maka-e2e-fixture`, which pauses every animation and transition
 * (base.css), something only the E2E harness does.
 *
 * This is the skills host and only the skills host. The plan-reminder page
 * mounts the same component inside `.maka-module-page-body` (module-shell.css),
 * which is a nested grid rather than a direct `.maka-module-main` child, so
 * `module-shell.css`'s `:has(> .maka-capability-audit-strip)` third grid row
 * does not apply there. Width and vertical-rhythm measurements taken here do
 * not transfer to that page. A second story would only be worth its scaffold
 * if someone were doing pixel work on the plan page; naming the divergence is
 * what stops a measurement here from being quietly reused there.

 * `.maka-module-main` is `grid-template-rows: auto minmax(0, 1fr)` and
 * `:has(> .maka-capability-audit-strip)` adds a third `auto`
 * (module-shell.css). With one child the strip lands in row 1 either way, so
 * the rule the frame exists to exercise is inert and the bug it fixed — the
 * strip in the `1fr` row, collapsed to ~0 height with its caption bleeding
 * over the banner below — cannot be reproduced or regressed here. Stand-ins
 * rather than the real PageHeader and SkillLibraryPanel: what the row
 * assignment needs is a preceding and a following sibling, not their contents,
 * and importing the whole skills page to get them would put this story back in
 * the business of approximating a screen it is not about.
